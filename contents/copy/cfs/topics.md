## Topics

To get a feel for what we are interested in hearing about, here is the programme for past years ([2012](https://2012.jsconf.eu/speakers.html), [2013](https://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/), [2014](https://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/), [2015](https://2015.jsconf.eu/speakers/), [2017](https://2017.jsconf.eu/speakers/), [2018](https://2018.jsconf.eu/speakers/)).

We like to see anything that squarely fits into the spectrum of:

* Cutting-edge technological advances in the world of JavaScript or computer science in general, if somehow applicable to JavaScript
* Wild Ideas & Clever Hacks
* Improving JavaScript developers’ lives
* Mobile JS
* Embedded JS
* Hardware JS
* Fundamentals, in a modern light
* The JavaScript community, culture, history, past, present & future, the why the who and the what of what we’re all doing
* And finally: Whatever the hell you want; this is your conference

For further inspiration, check out the video recordings of [JSConf EU 2018’s talks on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL37ZVnwpeshG2YXJkun_lyNTtM-Qb3MKa).

And remember: Pick whatever you feel most passionate about. This is your conference!

PS: If you can’t find a suitable topic for JSConf EU, or you want to try your luck at more than one event, then consider submitting a talk to our partner conference [CSSconf EU](https://2019.cssconf.eu) — it’s happening in the same venue on the same weekend, and you’re welcome to submit multiple talks.
